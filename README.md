This was my first ever project in web design! Completed ~Dec 2023

It is the first certification project of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Program.

It's pretty difficult to look at because of how ugly it is. There are many things I would like to change but I had a fun time making it and felt satisfied with what I was able to do.
